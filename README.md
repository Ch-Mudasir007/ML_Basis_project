Sentiment Analysis with Pre-trained Models
Objective: Learn to use pre-trained models for sentiment analysis on text data.
Tools: Python, Hugging Face, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Steps:
Collect a dataset of text reviews (e.g., movie reviews from IMDB).
Preprocess the text data (tokenization, cleaning).
Use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face to perform sentiment analysis.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
